# Santander Customer Transaction

The challenge is a binary-classification problem where the goal is to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future. The dataset contains "anonymized" columns containing numeric feature variables, the binary target column, and a string ID_code column. On the Kaggle webpage, the statement “… The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data we have available to solve this problem” indicates the probable use of synthetic data for privacy and security concerns.
