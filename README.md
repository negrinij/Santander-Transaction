# Santander-Cust-Transaction
This is currently an on-going project with Santander Customer Transaction prediction dataset. I started to work with it this week.

The challenge is a binary-classification problem where the goal is to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future. The dataset contains "anonymized" columns containing numeric feature variables, the binary target column, and a string ID_code column. On the Kaggle webpage, the statement “… The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data we have available to solve this problem” indicates the probable use of synthetic data for privacy and security concerns.

Please check the Notebook for the primary data insights and next steps.
